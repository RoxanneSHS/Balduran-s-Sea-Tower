@0    = ~Thank you for retrieving my heirloom, <CHARNAME>. Hey I heard that Gorion is leaving soon and wanted you to get supplies for the road; including a good weapon and this one is master-work! My grandfather Keel passed the sword down to my father and father passed this sword down to myself. The sword was made to defend friends of the family. I always wanted to pass it to my kid one day, *Sigh* but...~
@1    = ~Maybe I won't have kids and maybe I would regret one day to have let you go without protection. Gorion is a good friend and with all the bandits on the roads I figured you could protect yourselves better than I could stuck here. Yet this is a family heirloom, but for you it will cost ya 315 gold.~
@2    = ~A fair price, my friend. I have a dangerous journey ahead of me and I will need a good weapon. Here is the 315 gold to buy the long sword, Hull.~
@3    = ~Perhaps later, Hull; thank you for the offer. I have got to go, have a good day, my friend.~
@4    = ~Thanks for the gold, mate I will be needing that to pay off my mead fuelled gambling debt from last night, I nearly gambled this sword away ha! Ah yes and here is the long sword. I preferred training with halberds and quarter staves anyway ha! You better not be hacking trees with that sword it ain't no axe you hear!~
@5    = ~Best of luck, mate. Carry the sword well would'ya mate? I don't want to see you dragging that sword's scabbard thin! ~
@6    = ~I will carry the sword well, Hull. If anything happens on the road I got a fine sword to defend myself and Gorion~
@7    = ~Slay a monster for me, will ya mate? It gets so boring around here. Sometimes I wish I had joined the army to see more action. Eh, but the pay is good and steady and I don't know if I could give up being too far away from the mead cellars ha!~
