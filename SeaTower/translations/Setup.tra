@103 = ~Rings of accurate striking to such a degree of power as this ring are exceedingly rare among the realms but they do tend to emerge from time to time upon the bloodied paths carved out by champions of blood and steel in the endless churn of lives and deaths; felling swaths of lesser beings beneath their insatiable wrath. This magical ring is immaculately crafted by a master jeweller with a pure gold band enchanted with strong magical enchantments. The centrepiece of the ring is an obsidian black gemstone set masterfully in the ring from behind the band; a crafting feat that is very difficult indeed. The impenetrable black of the jewel centre-forth almost seems to demand one's eye. When blood flows, bones break and flesh rends the midnight black gem glows with authority and simmers with almost a will of its own upon one's grasp. The blood-hungry band pulls at one's hands with a mind of its own, guiding the wearers melee strikes to the folly of one's opponents. These incredibly effective magical rings are often the pride of any sellsword or champion of bloodied battle. Frequently one of these rings will land the owner in fierce duels of life and death for the right to wield one such of these rings. Masters at arms have killed for less than what one possesses and if one is to don such a powerful magical boon one should embrace the path of the bloodshed left by such rings; or act to conceal such items from any would-be next master of blood and steel.

@104 = ~Helm of Discipline 'The Visage of Gilgeam'~
@105 = ~This magical near entirely gold plated helm is of incredible strength considering that it is smithed from a bronze and iron alloy that most all venerable smiths of the common day would shy away from. It is readily believed by most of the armour smithing profession that such a mixture of metals to be used as a safeguard against cranial impact given the softer nature of bronze is not advisable for all but ceremonial purposes. Alas this helm provides the strength necessary to shield the wearer from all but the most determined of blows struck upon the skull. Given the unexpected metallurgic nature of such a helm one might assume that magic were at play for such a solid composition yet surprisingly no such magic is used to strengthen helm's uncommon alloy other than to prevent the decorative gold plating of the helm's exterior from scratching off. Upon further divination it is found that this helm heralds from the lands of the old empire of Unther within the East of Faerûn. Although as peculiar as the Unther smiths' metal trickery of this helm is, most will agree that it still fails to intrigue to the same manner as that of the blessing gifted upon this helm by none other than the God-King of Unther himself known as Gilgeam. This helm bears the mark of an elite legion of the Unther empire and more specifically the rather difficult to decipher Untheric runes that proclaim the following: "Awarded from the God-King Gilgeam himself as gratitude towards the merits of outstanding discipline and superior command." It is believed that such a blessed helm will only be given to the most stoic and devastating of elite legionaries of the legions of Unther. Additionally it is also believed that these enchanted varieties of helm from within the old empire of Unther are also known as 'The Visage of Gilgeam'. It is told that such helms are given as promotions to the most deadly and subsequently elite of Unther legionaries as a safeguards to keep them from turning on their own soldiers in case of a berserking curse were to be laid upon them by an opposing force. It is rumoured that Gilgeam 'Father of Victory' was deeply embarrassed when one of his most prized elite legions was all but wiped out by a group of Mulhorand spell casters. To put salt in Gilgeam's wound, his elite legion was struck down by their own blades after a clever band of Mulhorand spell casters broke the ranks of the elite legion nicknamed 'Gilgeam's Pride' with a series of berserking curses while being completely unscathed by the legion in the process. The curses were later found out by a interrogated Mulhorand priest to have been laid on the legion's own swords the night before they slew themselves while the legionaries were distracted by prostitutes hired by the Mulhorand spell casters. As to how such a prized and treasured item from both within and abroad of Unther found its way into your possession is unknown. Although one may happen a guess that if such an item was stolen from its owner then there would likely be those incentivized by large amounts gold and other such likely rewards to search for the helm's unmistakable golden exterior and deep red plume. Then again one may come across a rich collector avid to purchase the prized helm to further expand their collection of rare and highly sought after elite Unther legionnaire equipment. It is said that such items as these are relics of an older and more grander time of the Unther empire and thus fetch a very high price from private collectors of the like. With anyway that one looks at this helm, one can be certain of at least of one thing and that is if one were to don this helm in the lands of Unther within the gaze of many a Unther legion - it would surely be removed in quick succession from one's shoulders along with one's own head.

As a result of the robust magical enchantments endowed upon the armour suit, the rigidity of the metal plates and leather straps that bind the armour together have been remarkably improved. As to which has also been magically improved is the lessened overall weight and reduced general encumbrance of the field plate armour upon the wearer.

Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting. This finely crafted long sword is a master-work weapon that is razor sharp along both blades to render the sword more effective in combat. The weapon is slightly on the larger scale of long swords and any inferior smithing would have rendered the blade slightly unwieldy for one hand. Yet with the superior craftsmanship displayed within the forging of this potent weapon the blade is finely balanced and can be easily fought with in one hand. Additionally this elegant yet not enchanted long sword is finely engraved with intricate swirling motifs. This particular master-work long sword is a family heirloom of Hull of Candlekeep. So far the sword has been passed down two generations to Hull from his late grandfather Keel.

There are also some notes about failed attempts. One of them happened at the Firewine Bridge but the children he had been after escaped into the safety of Candlekeep.)

21st of Nightal, 1366:  I am in Baldur's Gate. The young man I follow is the foster child of a corrupt merchant involved with the Iron Throne. I am too ragged to appear before the father to offer my services as a teacher but maybe I can get the trust of the boy directly.

8th of Flamerule, 1367: I met him today - young, strong, self confident Sarevok. Unkempt material for my plans. I gave him my History of the Time of Troubles. I know it will prepare him. I must give him a few days for the poison to settle in his brain.

20th of Eleint, 1367:  The time was right, I knew it.  I met with Sarevok while Rieltar was out of town. I told him what he had felt already, that he was indeed one of the fallen Bhaal's many offspring. I confessed to him that I had been apprentice to a Deathstalker, and therefore knew the signs.  I told him of his potential and offered to train him as my sole pupil.  It appeared that it was a moment we both have yearned for.

9th of Uktar, 1367:  Today I presented Sarevok with the location of a nearby sect of Cyricists, who have made a particular practice of researching everything they can about Bhaal, and especially his successor.  It only makes sense that Cyric would be very interested in the offspring of his fallen foe, rising to reclaim his portfolio.  I advised Sarevok to capture one or more of their leaders and extract their knowledge from them, but he immediately wanted to shoot higher and interrogate them all. He gets more confident and unmanageable at times. He also plans to gather his own acolytes to support his increasing operations.

14th of Kythorn, 1368:  I have arranged for the doppelgangers to secretly arrive at Baldur's Gate. We want to keep them out of sight and the Iron Throne is too frequented to use it as quarters. Rieltar's connections offered us the option to use an old prison tract in Balduran's Sea Tower that is closed for the public. I have found room there to establish my new quarter and oversee the activities.

(There follow entries about Winski's declining health and how the new acolytes, especially Semaj, Cythandria and Tamoko take more important roles in Sarevok's circle while Winski's plan to fully control Sarevok and mobilize him against Rashemen becomes more unrealistic with every day.)~

In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form. Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few that knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity. Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts. Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated that she became one with the very blade of her weapon. Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own. It is now exceedingly deadly in combat. This fine beautifully crafted blade has been augmented via the master smith Michael of Baldur's Gate to become a force to be reckoned with. The latent cold rage burning deep within the blade's core of this ferocious weapon has been magnified and is the very source of the weapon's magical potency. Drawing from the sword's characteristic magical powers, the master smith has additionally unlocked a tremendous font of protective power that was laying dormant deep within the blade's soul. With such mastery of the craft Michael of Baldur's Gate has reforged this already exquisite weapon into a deadly bulwark that grants the wielder protection against nigh every kind mental deterrence. This instrument of carnage is one of the greatest safeguards in all of FaerÃ»n that one can possess from anything that can hinder one's path of destruction.
